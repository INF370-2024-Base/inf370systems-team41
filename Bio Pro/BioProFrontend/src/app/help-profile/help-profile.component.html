                <h4 class="searchable">What is required to update my password?</h4>
                <p>To update your password, you need to enter your current password, choose a new password, and confirm the new password. Ensure the new password meets the system's security requirements, which include a minimum length of 6 characters, an uppercase letter, and a special character.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="searchable">
                <h4 class="searchable">Why is the password update form locked?</h4>
                <p>The form locks after 1.5 minutes of inactivity to ensure security. If locked, you need to wait for 5 minutes before you can attempt to update your password again.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="searchable">
                <h4 class="searchable">What happens if I enter the wrong current password?</h4>
                <p>If the current password you entered does not match your account password, the update will fail, and you will receive an error message. Double-check the password and try again.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="searchable">
                <h4 class="searchable">How do I ensure my new password is strong?</h4>
                <p>Make sure your new password contains at least 6 characters, including an uppercase letter and a special character (e.g., *, !, #). This helps protect your account from unauthorized access.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="searchable">
                <h4 class="searchable">What if the passwords I enter do not match?</h4>
                <p>If your new password and confirm password fields do not match, the system will display an error. You need to ensure both passwords are the same before submitting.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="searchable">
                <h4 class="searchable">Can I update my password if I forget my current password?</h4>

              </li>
              <li class="searchable">
                <h4 class="searchable">What happens after I successfully update my password?</h4>

              </li>
              <li class="searchable">
                <h4 class="searchable">Why does the password update form lock after some time?</h4>
                <p>The form locks after 1.5 minutes of inactivity to enhance security. Once locked, the form will be inaccessible for 5 minutes. After the lock duration, you can attempt to update your password again.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="searchable">
                <h4 class="searchable">What should I do if my current password is not recognized?</h4>
                <p>If the system does not recognize your current password, double-check the password entered. If you still encounter issues, consider using the 'Forgot Password' feature to reset your password.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="searchable">
                <h4 class="searchable">What happens if the 'Confirm Password' field does not match the new password?</h4>
                <p>If the new password and confirm password fields do not match, the system will show an error. You must re-enter the correct password in both fields to proceed with the update.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="searchable">
                <h4 class="searchable">Can I update my password if I forget my current one?</h4>

              <li class="searchable">
                <h4 class="searchable">Will I be logged out after successfully updating my password?</h4>

        <h4 class="searchable">Can I filter the audit trail to see transactions from a specific date range?</h4>
        <p>Yes, you can filter the audit trail by selecting a 'Start Date' and an 'End Date'. This filter allows you to narrow down the list of transactions to only those that occurred within the specified date range. Use the date pickers to select the desired dates, and the audit trail will update automatically.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="searchable">
        <h4 class="searchable">How can I view audit trail entries for a specific user?</h4>
        <p>To view the transactions performed by a specific user, use the 'User' dropdown filter on the audit trail page. This will display a list of unique users, identified by their email addresses, and allow you to select a specific user. Once selected, the table will filter to show only the actions performed by that user.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="searchable">
        <h4 class="searchable">What does the 'Transaction Type' refer to, and how can I use it to filter results?</h4>
        <p>The 'Transaction Type' represents the kind of action taken by the user (e.g., 'Create', 'Update', 'Delete'). You can filter the audit trail by selecting a specific transaction type from the 'Transaction Type' dropdown, enabling you to focus on only certain kinds of system activities, such as updates or deletions.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="searchable">
        <h4 class="searchable">What information is available in the 'Additional Data' column?</h4>
        <p>The 'Additional Data' column provides further context about the transaction, such as what record was affected, the changes made, or any other details that were part of the action. This data is critical for understanding the full scope of the action performed and can help in auditing the exact nature of the change.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="searchable">
        <h4 class="searchable">How do I reset the filters if I want to see the full audit trail again?</h4>
        <p>If you want to clear all filters and return to viewing the complete list of audit trail entries, you can click the 'Clear Filters' button. This will reset the 'Start Date', 'End Date', 'User', and 'Transaction Type' filters, allowing you to see all transactions logged in the system without restrictions.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="searchable">
        <h4 class="searchable">How can I sort the audit trail data by date or other columns?</h4>
        <p>You can sort the audit trail by clicking on the headers of any column. For example, clicking on the 'Date of Transaction' column header will sort the table by date in ascending or descending order, allowing you to quickly find the most recent or oldest transactions. This functionality also applies to the other columns, such as 'System User' and 'Transaction Type'.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="searchable">
        <h4 class="searchable">Can I export the audit trail for external review?</h4>
        <p>Currently, the system does not provide an export function directly through the UI. If you need to export the audit trail data for external review or backup purposes, contact your system administrator, who may be able to assist with exporting the data directly from the database or back-end system.</p>

            <h4 class="searchable">Why is the audit trail not displaying any data?</h4>
            <p>If no audit trail entries are visible, there could be several reasons. First, ensure that the filters you applied (e.g., date range, user, or transaction type) are not too restrictive. If the filters are clear and no data is still showing, it could indicate a connection issue or a system error. Try refreshing the page or contacting technical support.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="searchable">
            <h4 class="searchable">What should I do if the audit trail page is slow to load?</h4>
            <p>Loading delays may be caused by a large amount of data being retrieved. Try applying filters to reduce the number of entries displayed at once, or check your network connection. If the issue persists, contact technical support to investigate further.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="searchable">
            <h4 class="searchable">Why am I unable to filter the audit trail by user?</h4>
            <p>If the 'User' filter is not working, it could be due to missing data for some audit trail entries or a system issue. Ensure that the user you are looking for has performed actions logged in the audit trail, and try clearing other filters to expand the results. If the issue persists, contact support for further assistance.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="searchable">
            <h4 class="searchable">What should I do if the date range filter isn't working correctly?</h4>
            <p>If you're experiencing issues with filtering by date, double-check that the 'Start Date' is before the 'End Date'. If the filter still doesn't apply, try clearing the date filters and setting them again. Persistent problems may require contacting technical support.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="searchable">
            <h4 class="searchable">Why do some audit trail entries lack details in the 'Additional Data' column?</h4>
            <p>In some cases, the 'Additional Data' column may not contain detailed information if the transaction didn't involve specific data changes or if the log entry was incomplete. If you frequently see incomplete entries, report the issue to technical support.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="searchable">
            <h4 class="searchable">How do I fix a broken or missing filter on the audit trail page?</h4>
            <p>If a filter option is not functioning as expected, such as the user or transaction type filter, first try clearing all filters and applying them again. If the issue persists, it could indicate a bug or system error, in which case contacting support is recommended.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="searchable">
            <h4 class="searchable">What can I do if the audit trail fails to refresh with new data?</h4>
            <p>If new transactions are not appearing in the audit trail, try refreshing the page manually. The audit trail should update in real-time, so if the issue persists, ensure your internet connection is stable or contact support to ensure the system is logging new transactions properly.</p>

          <li class="searchable">
            <h4 class="searchable">Why am I getting a server error when trying to view the audit trail?</h4>
