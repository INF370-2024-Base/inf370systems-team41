            <h3>How do I view the details of an existing procedural timeline?</h3>
            <p>Details of each procedural timeline are displayed within individual cards on the Order Timeline page. Scroll through the page to view all timelines.</p>
            
            <h3>Why can't I see any orders to select?</h3>
            <p>Only orders that are in progress and have no existing procedural timeline will be displayed. Ensure there are such orders available.</p>
    
            <h3>Can I edit an existing procedural timeline?</h3>

            <h3>Why is the procedural timeline description important?</h3>
            <p>The description provides context for the procedural steps and helps in identifying the purpose and details of the timeline.</p>
    
            <h3>How often is the procedural timeline information updated?</h3>
            <p>The information is updated in real-time. Any changes made are immediately reflected on the Order Timeline page.</p>

            <h3>Is it possible to filter timelines by status?</h3>

            <h3>Can I export the timeline data?</h3>
            <p>At the moment, exporting timeline data is not supported. If you need to export data, please contact the support team for assistance.</p>
    
            <h3>Why are some timeline details not visible?</h3>
            <p>Some timeline details might not be visible due to missing or incomplete data. Ensure that all required fields are filled out when creating a timeline.</p>
